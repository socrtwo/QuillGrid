# Roadmap

> **Plan.** QuillStage has no code yet. Milestones are ordered by dependency, not by date. Each milestone ends with a tagged prerelease built for every platform by the release workflow, starting with M1. Command ids refer to [COMMANDS-PLAN.md](COMMANDS-PLAN.md).

## M0 — Planning (this repository)

- [x] README, feature survey ([INNOVATIONS.md](INNOVATIONS.md)), Quick Access Bar plan ([QAT.md](QAT.md)), command inventory ([COMMANDS-PLAN.md](COMMANDS-PLAN.md)), architecture plan ([ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md](ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md)), legal notes, license, contributing guide and issue templates.
- [ ] Verify the Quick Access Toolbar drop-down choices against installed copies of each desktop version and update the footnotes in QAT.md.
- [ ] Collect a corpus of openly licensed test decks (.pptx, .odp, .ppt) made with different programs.

## Recovery (throughout)

The recovery engine is brought over from the sister apps in M1 (identification, ZIP salvage, XML healing) and grows with the formats: .pptx rebuild, slide-by-slide salvage, media harvest and text scan in M2; .ppt record salvage and .odp salvage in M2–M3. Each format arrives with damaged-file tests.
